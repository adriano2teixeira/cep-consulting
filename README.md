## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
Open the Browser to see the result.

Technologies:
NextJS : I prefer using this framework because i'm used to and like using it because it is very good when starting a new reactjs project in the modern days.

Chackra: Chakra UI is a simple, modular and accessible component library that gives you the building blocks you need to build your React applications.


Deployment:
```The production version is deployed on Vercel```

Why vercel?
As i'm using the nextjs framework, vercel has a great support for this stack, so it is realy easy to setup all things and get all up and running there, even with the CI aproach.

```cep-consulting.vercel.com```

But, there is also one instance of the same application on heroku:
```cep-consulting.herokuapp.com```


Production:
``yarn start``
